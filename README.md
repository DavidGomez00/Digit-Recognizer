# Digit-Recognizer
This repository contains the code needed to identify handwritten numbers using CNNs.

The goal of this repository is to contain the code used to train a convolutional neural network capable of perfectly predicting handwritten digits. It consists of a practical exercise to complete the Kaggle challenge "Digit Recognizer": https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview to get started with Kaggle challenges.
The dataset used is available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data.
